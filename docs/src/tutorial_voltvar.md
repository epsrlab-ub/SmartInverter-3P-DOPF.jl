# Modeling Smart Inverters in Three-Phase Distribution Optimal Power Flow

A smart inverter does not accept a reactive-power set-point as an input. Rather, it follows a Volt-VAr curve: it measures its own terminal voltage and decides, on its own, how much reactive power to inject or absorb. A distribution optimal power flow (DOPF) problem that ignores the curve will return a reactive dispatch that could be unsuitable at the local inverter controller level.

Real low-voltage feeders are unbalanced. Loads and rooftop inverters connect between one phase and neutral, so the three phases carry different currents and sit at different voltages, and an inverter on phase *a* senses a different terminal voltage from its neighbour on phase *b* at the very same bus. This tutorial is three-phase throughout: every formulation, every host and every result below is written for an unbalanced multiphase network.

It shows three ways to embed the Volt-VAr curve into a three-phase DOPF, so that every dispatch point the solver returns is one the inverter would actually produce. All three are exact formulations of the curve and, on the case study below, all three return the same answer. What separates them is the solver technology they demand and how they scale.

To keep the separation between *encoding* and *network model* measurable rather than merely asserted, the three encodings are run against **two** three-phase hosts, a linear one and a near-exact one. Six runs, one curve, and an exact power flow to decide between the hosts.

Both feeders used below are real Electricity North West low-voltage networks from the
*Low Voltage Network Solutions* project, Kron-reduced to three wires: `network_5_Feeder_2`
[[14]](#ref-14) for the case study and `network_17_Feeder_6` [[15]](#ref-15) for the
scalability check. The Kron reduction follows [[16]](#ref-16), and the conductor impedances
are those of [[17]](#ref-17).

## Prerequisites

Everything on this page is Julia: the code blocks run in Julia, and the six example
scripts in the repository are Julia programs. No prior Julia knowledge is assumed, but
the environment has to be set up before any of it will run.

### Getting Julia

This package requires **Julia 1.10 or newer**, and is tested on 1.10 and on the current
release. If you do not have Julia yet, install it with
[juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup), or via the
[Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9NJNWW8PVKMN) (or
`winget install julia -s msstore`) on Windows, or with
`curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh` on macOS and Linux.

Alternatively, take an installer from
[julialang.org/downloads](https://julialang.org/downloads/).

### Get the code

The six example scripts, both feeders, the load and irradiance profiles and the committed
results all live in the repository, so the first step is to clone it. Every command on
this page is run from the directory this creates:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/epsrlab-ub/SmartInverter-3P-DOPF.jl
cd SmartInverter-3P-DOPF.jl
```

### Choosing an environment

Julia installs packages into an *environment*, and a fresh environment starts out empty.
Plain `julia` uses the shared default environment; `julia --project=.` uses the one
described by the `Project.toml` in the current directory.

The three-phase example scripts are **standalone**: they carry their own `Project.toml`,
they do not depend on this repository being installed as a package, and one command
installs everything they need:

```bash
julia --project=examples/three_phase -e "using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()"
```

That is the whole setup. The sections below matter mainly when you are assembling an
environment of your own.

### Packages

Every package the three-phase scripts use is in the General registry, Julia's default
package catalogue, so it can be added by name:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(["JuMP", "JSON3", "Plots"])              # modelling, data files, figures
Pkg.add(["Printf", "LinearAlgebra"])             # standard library
```

| package | what it is for |
|:--|:--|
| `JuMP` | the modelling layer every formulation on this page is written in |
| `JSON3` | reading the feeder, load and irradiance files, and the committed results |
| `Plots` | every figure |
| `Printf` | formatting the printed output and the tables |
| `LinearAlgebra` | the 3×3 phase impedances that make the network model three-phase |

The last two ship with Julia, but a project environment still has to add them before
`using` will find them. Make sure all of this is installed in the same environment you
run the code from. `Pkg.status()` lists what the active environment already has, and a
`using` line that raises `ArgumentError: Package X not found` means `Pkg.add("X")` has
not been run for it.

If you also want the Julia package in `src/` (still named `SmartInverterDOPF`) rather than
only the standalone scripts, it is not in the registry and installs from its Git URL:

```julia
Pkg.add(url = "https://github.com/epsrlab-ub/SmartInverter-3P-DOPF.jl")
```

### Solvers

Two of the three encodings produce a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) and need an MILP
solver; the third produces a nonlinear program (NLP) and needs an NLP solver. Both
solvers used here are in the General registry:

```julia
Pkg.add(["Gurobi", "Ipopt"])
```

| encoding | model class | solver used here |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Big-M, Lambda / SOS2 | MILP | Gurobi |
| Heaviside | NLP | Ipopt |

Gurobi is commercial and needs a licence, and is
[free for academic users](https://www.gurobi.com/academia/academic-program-and-licenses/).
Ipopt is open source and needs no licence, so the Heaviside route runs with no
commercial software at all.

#### Installing Gurobi

`Pkg.add("Gurobi")` installs the wrapper and, with it, the Gurobi binaries from
[`Gurobi_jll`](https://github.com/jump-dev/Gurobi_jll.jl), so there is no separate solver
download to do. What it does not install is a **licence**, and the size-limited trial
licence that ships with those binaries is nowhere near enough for the models here: the
case study builds a few hundred thousand variables and the scalability check 3.3 million.

To get one, register at [gurobi.com](https://www.gurobi.com) and request a licence,
which is [free for academics](https://www.gurobi.com/academia/academic-program-and-licenses/).
What you do next depends on the licence type.

A **Web License Service (WLS)** licence is a file named `gurobi.lic`, holding your
`WLSACCESSID`, `WLSSECRET` and `LICENSEID`. Save it in your home directory and nothing
further is needed:

| | home directory | the file goes at |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Windows | `C:\Users\<you>`, that is `%USERPROFILE%` | `C:\Users\<you>\gurobi.lic` |
| macOS | `/Users/<you>` | `~/gurobi.lic` |
| Linux | `/home/<you>` | `~/gurobi.lic` |

To keep it somewhere else, set the `GRB_LICENSE_FILE` environment variable to the file's
full path and Gurobi will read it from there instead.

A **named-user** licence is fetched with `grbgetkey`:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("Gurobi_jll")
import Gurobi_jll
key = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"     # your own key
run(`$(Gurobi_jll.grbgetkey()) $key`)
```

If you already run a full Gurobi installation of your own and want Julia to use that
instead of the bundled binaries, point `GUROBI_HOME` at it, opt out, and rebuild:

```julia
ENV["GUROBI_HOME"] = "C:\\gurobi1200\\win64"    # or /Library/gurobi1200/macos_universal2
ENV["GUROBI_JL_USE_GUROBI_JLL"] = "false"
Pkg.add("Gurobi")
Pkg.build("Gurobi")
```

To confirm the licence is live, solve something trivial:

```julia
using JuMP, Gurobi
model = Model(Gurobi.Optimizer)
@variable(model, x >= 0)
@objective(model, Min, x)
optimize!(model)        # prints the licence banner, then reports OPTIMAL
```

Ipopt needs none of this. `Pkg.add("Ipopt")` is the whole installation.

!!! note "On open-source MILP solvers"
    We also tried the open-source MILP solvers **HiGHS** and **GLPK** on this model.
    Neither worked out. One returned an infeasible status inside the
    successive-linearisation loop, the other was too slow to finish. The results
    throughout this documentation are produced with Gurobi.

    If no MILP solver is available at all, the Heaviside encoding needs **only
    Ipopt**, which is open source, and reaches the same answer. That is a practical
    reason to consider an integer-free formulation.

## Why the curve has to be embedded in the DOPF

IEEE 1547-2018 [[1]](#ref-1) requires every interconnecting distributed energy resource (DER) to be
capable
of Volt-VAr control. The utility enables the function and sets the curve; the inverter
then runs it autonomously as a local feedback law. An advanced distribution management
system (ADMS) can coordinate hundreds of these inverters through a DOPF, but only if
that DOPF knows the law each one is following.

Leave the curve out and the DOPF treats each inverter's reactive output as a free decision
variable inside its apparent-power circle. It will pick whatever value minimises the
objective. The inverter, meanwhile, is looking at its own terminal voltage and producing
something else entirely. The dispatch is not merely suboptimal; it is not physically
realisable.

Put the curve in, and the feasible set shrinks to exactly the points the fleet can
actually reach. As a bonus, once the curve is an algebraic object inside the model, its
breakpoints can themselves become decision variables, which is how droop curves get
optimised rather than merely respected.

On an unbalanced feeder the argument is sharper still. The inverters on a low-voltage
network are single-phase devices scattered across the three phases, and the phase they
sit on decides the voltage they read. Two identically rated inverters can therefore sit on
different segments of the same curve at the same instant, one idle in the dead-band and
the other absorbing hard, purely because their phases sit at different voltages. A model
that cannot tell the phases apart cannot predict what either of them will do; the spread
between the three phases on the feeder used below is Figures 3 and 4.

## The IEEE 1547 Volt-VAr law

The characteristic specified in IEEE Std 1547-2018 [[1]](#ref-1) is piecewise linear in
five segments, defined by six breakpoint voltages
``V^{\text{bp}}_1 \le \dots \le V^{\text{bp}}_6`` and the reactive set-point at each. Writing
``\bar q_i`` for the reactive capability of inverter ``i`` and ``v_i`` for the voltage it
senses at its own terminal:

```math
q_i(v_i) \;=\;
\begin{cases}
\bar q_i, & V^{\text{bp}}_1 \le v_i \le V^{\text{bp}}_2 \quad\text{(full injection)}\\[4pt]
\bar q_i \dfrac{V^{\text{bp}}_3 - v_i}{V^{\text{bp}}_3 - V^{\text{bp}}_2},
        & V^{\text{bp}}_2 \le v_i \le V^{\text{bp}}_3 \quad\text{(sloped)}\\[6pt]
0, & V^{\text{bp}}_3 \le v_i \le V^{\text{bp}}_4 \quad\text{(dead-band)}\\[4pt]
-\bar q_i \dfrac{v_i - V^{\text{bp}}_4}{V^{\text{bp}}_5 - V^{\text{bp}}_4},
        & V^{\text{bp}}_4 \le v_i \le V^{\text{bp}}_5 \quad\text{(sloped)}\\[6pt]
-\bar q_i, & V^{\text{bp}}_5 \le v_i \le V^{\text{bp}}_6 \quad\text{(full absorption)}
\end{cases} \tag{1}
```

Low voltage means inject reactive power to hold the voltage up; high voltage means
absorb it. Between the two sits a dead-band in which the inverter does nothing, so that
small fluctuations do not provoke needless reactive flow.

```@example tut
Vbp, qshape = collect(Float64, tpc.Vbp), collect(Float64, tpc.qshape)
plot(Vbp, qshape, lw = 3, color = :steelblue, label = "IEEE 1547 Q-V droop",
     xlabel = "terminal voltage  v  (p.u.)", ylabel = "q / q̄",
     title = "The Volt-VAr characteristic", ylims = (-1.35, 1.35), legend = :topright)
scatter!(Vbp, qshape, ms = 5, color = :steelblue, label = "breakpoints")
vspan!([Vbp[3], Vbp[4]], color = :grey, alpha = 0.12, label = "dead-band")
hline!([0], color = :black, lw = 0.6, alpha = 0.5, label = false)
annotate!([(Vbp[1] + 0.007, 1.13, text("inject", 8, :left, :steelblue)),
           (Vbp[6] - 0.007, -1.13, text("absorb", 8, :right, :steelblue))])
```

**Figure 1.** The IEEE 1547 Volt-VAr characteristic: a five-segment piecewise-linear law relating the inverter's own terminal voltage to its reactive output.

The curve used throughout this tutorial is the package default: breakpoints inside the
range the standard [[1]](#ref-1) permits the utility to set, and the values used in
[[6]](#ref-6):

## Why an "if-else" cannot go straight into a solver

The law above is a definition by cases, and that is exactly what a solver cannot read.
Two distinct obstacles follow.

**Conditional logic.** Which of the five expressions applies depends on ``v_i``, which is
itself a decision variable. Branching on the value of an unknown is not an algebraic
constraint, and an algebraic constraint is the only thing a solver accepts.

**Non-differentiability.** Even setting the branching aside, the slope jumps at every
breakpoint. Newton and interior-point methods build their steps from derivatives, and at
a kink the derivative does not exist.

There are two ways out, and they define the rest of this tutorial:

- **Introduce integer variables** to encode the logic exactly. The model becomes an
  MILP. This is the Big-M and Lambda / special-ordered-set-of-type-2 (SOS2) route.
- **Write the logic in closed algebraic form** using step functions. The model stays
  integer-free but becomes non-smooth, so it needs an NLP solver. This is the Heaviside
  route.

Before the details, here is the whole comparison on one screen. Each method answers a
different question, and that choice determines everything else about it:

**Table 2.** The three exact encodings of the droop at a glance.

| | **Big-M** | **Lambda / SOS2** | **Heaviside** |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|

| the device | one binary per segment, plus a large constant ``M`` | shared weights ``\lambda_b``, plus SOS2 adjacency | products of unit steps |
| extra variables, per inverter per time step | 5 binary + 2 continuous | 5 binary + 6 continuous | **none** |

| anything to tune? | yes, the value of ``M`` | no | no |
| introduced in | [[5]](#ref-5) | [[6]](#ref-6), [[7]](#ref-7) | [[10]](#ref-10) |

The three columns are three answers to one question: how do you say "it depends" to a
solver? Each pays for exactness in a different currency: a constant you must choose,
a combinatorial structure, or differentiability.

### The one scalar the droop needs from the network

The droop is a self-contained module. Whatever DOPF you use, it exposes a voltage
magnitude at each inverter terminal; the droop module adds the relationship tying that
inverter's reactive output to that voltage:

```
        ┌────────────────────────────┐
        │       three-phase DOPF     │
        │  network model + limits    │
        └───────┬────────────▲───────┘
  exposes v_b^φ │            │ q_i^G sets
        ┌───────▼────────────┴───────┐
        │      Q-V droop module      │
        │   the IEEE 1547 curve      │
        └────────────────────────────┘
```

On a three-phase network that interface needs one sentence of care, and it is the only
place phases enter the droop at all. Take the bus set ``\Upsilon``, the phase set
``\Psi = \{a,b,c\}`` and the inverter fleet ``\mathcal{G}``. A rooftop inverter is a
single-phase device connected line-to-neutral, so inverter ``i \in \mathcal{G}`` has a
bus ``b(i) \in \Upsilon`` **and a phase** ``\varphi(i) \in \Psi``, and the voltage it
senses is that bus on that phase alone:

```math
v_i \;:=\; v_{b(i)}^{\varphi(i)},
\qquad i \in \mathcal{G}
```

Every constraint in the three sections below is written in terms of this one scalar per
inverter per time step, together with that inverter's reactive output ``q_i^{G}`` and its
reactive capability ``\bar q_i``. The time index ``t \in \{1,\dots,T\}`` is suppressed
throughout; on the case study ``T = 96``, a full day at 15-minute resolution.

Two consequences are worth stating before the algebra starts, because they are what make
the droop portable.

**The encodings do not know what a phase is.** Each asks the host for one scalar voltage
variable and constrains one scalar reactive output against it. Whether that terminal is
identified by a bus, or by a bus and a phase, changes the *subscript* and nothing else.
That is why the same three blocks drop unchanged into either of the two hosts below: in
LinDist3Flow ``v_b^{\varphi}`` is a decision variable directly, in the three-phase
IVACOPF it is a linearised voltage magnitude, and the droop neither knows nor cares.

**The counting does change.** A balanced single-phase study puts one inverter at a bus;
an unbalanced LV feeder can put a single-phase inverter at every service connection, and
the binaries in Big-M and Lambda scale with inverters × time steps. On the case study
below, twelve inverters over 96 steps come to 5760 binaries. That is the arithmetic that
eventually makes the integer-free encoding look attractive, and it is measured in
[Does it scale?](@ref).

In the JuMP snippets below, `PV` is the vector of inverter sites, each carrying a `bus`,
a `phase` and a rating `Smax`; `v` is whatever voltage variable the host exposes, indexed
by bus, phase and time step; and `vpv` is the sensing map written out:

```julia
vpv(i, t) = v[PV[i].bus, PV[i].phase, t]     # the voltage inverter i actually senses
```

The hosts themselves come after the three encodings.

## Method A — Big-M

*Following Savasci, Inaolaji and Paudyal [[5]](#ref-5), where this formulation was introduced for
a second-order-cone DOPF; also Chapter 4 of Inaolaji's dissertation [[9]](#ref-9).*

**The idea in one sentence.** Give every segment its own on/off switch, and write
constraints that are *switched off*, made trivially true, whenever their segment is
not the active one.

That switching-off is what "big-M" means. Take any constraint you want to enforce only
when a binary ``\delta`` equals 1, and add ``M(1-\delta)`` to its right-hand side. If
``\delta = 1`` the added term vanishes and the constraint bites. If ``\delta = 0`` the
right-hand side becomes so large that the constraint cannot possibly be violated; it is
still *present* in the model, but it no longer restricts anything. One constant, ``M``,
buys you an if-statement.

Everything below is written per inverter ``i \in \mathcal{G}``, and the voltage it reasons
about is the one its own phase at its own bus, ``v_i = v_{b(i)}^{\varphi(i)}``. A fleet of
twelve single-phase inverters spread over three phases therefore carries twelve
independent copies of this system at every time step.

**Step 1: exactly one segment is active.** Introduce a binary ``\delta_{i,b}`` for each of
the five segments of inverter ``i`` and require

```math
\sum_{b=1}^{5}\delta_{i,b}=1,
\qquad \forall i \in \mathcal{G} . \tag{2}
```

**Step 2: each switch owns a voltage window.** If segment ``b`` is the active one, then
the sensed voltage must lie in that segment's range ``[V^{\text{bp}}_{b},
V^{\text{bp}}_{b+1}]``. Written once with the phase visible, so there is no doubt which
voltage is meant,

```math
V^{\text{bp}}_{b} - M(1-\delta_{i,b}) \;\le\; v_{b(i)}^{\varphi(i)}
   \;\le\; V^{\text{bp}}_{b+1} + M(1-\delta_{i,b}),
```

and in big-M form that is one two-sided inequality per segment. Writing all five out, with
``v_i`` for ``v_{b(i)}^{\varphi(i)}`` from here on, gives the complete window system:

```math
\begin{aligned}
-(1-\delta_{i,1})M + V^{l}\;\; &\le v_i \le\;\; V^{\text{bp}}_{2} + (1-\delta_{i,1})M\\
-(1-\delta_{i,2})M + V^{\text{bp}}_{2} &\le v_i \le\;\; V^{\text{bp}}_{3} + (1-\delta_{i,2})M\\
-(1-\delta_{i,3})M + V^{\text{bp}}_{3} &\le v_i \le\;\; V^{\text{bp}}_{4} + (1-\delta_{i,3})M\\
-(1-\delta_{i,4})M + V^{\text{bp}}_{4} &\le v_i \le\;\; V^{\text{bp}}_{5} + (1-\delta_{i,4})M\\
-(1-\delta_{i,5})M + V^{\text{bp}}_{5} &\le v_i \le\;\; V^{u} + (1-\delta_{i,5})M
\end{aligned} \tag{3}
```

Each row is vacuous when its ``\delta_{i,b} = 0`` and binding when ``\delta_{i,b} = 1``, so
together with Step 1 the solver is forced to pick the segment that genuinely contains
``v_i``. Note the two outer rows: the first segment is bounded below by the voltage
variable's own lower bound ``V^{l}`` and the last above by ``V^{u}``, rather than by
``V^{\text{bp}}_{1}`` and ``V^{\text{bp}}_{6}``. That keeps the model feasible if ``v_i``
ever sits outside the range the curve was drawn over; the saturated laws simply continue
to apply.

**Step 3: assemble the droop law, and watch it turn nonlinear.** With the switches in
place, ``q_i^G`` is just the sum of the five segment laws, each weighted by its own
binary. Segments 1, 3 and 5 contribute constants (``\bar q_i``, ``0``, ``-\bar q_i``);
the two sloped segments contribute their affine laws, written in slope-intercept form:

```math
q_i^G \;=\; \delta_{i,1}\,\bar q_i
\;+\; \delta_{i,2}\!\left(\alpha_{i,1} v_i + \frac{\bar q_i V^{\text{bp}}_3}{V^{\text{bp}}_3 - V^{\text{bp}}_2}\right)
\;+\; \delta_{i,3}\cdot 0
\;+\; \delta_{i,4}\!\left(\alpha_{i,2} v_i + \frac{\bar q_i V^{\text{bp}}_4}{V^{\text{bp}}_5 - V^{\text{bp}}_4}\right)
\;+\; \delta_{i,5}\left(-\bar q_i\right) \tag{4}
```

with slopes ``\alpha_{i,1} = -\bar q_i/(V^{\text{bp}}_3-V^{\text{bp}}_2)`` and
``\alpha_{i,2} = -\bar q_i/(V^{\text{bp}}_5-V^{\text{bp}}_4)``. Both are inverter-specific,
because ``\bar q_i`` is: on the case study below the fleet carries four size classes, so
four different pairs of slopes appear in one model.

This is a correct statement of the curve: exactly one ``\delta_{i,b}`` equals 1, so exactly
one bracket survives and ``q_i^G`` takes that segment's value. But it is **not linear**.
Multiply the two sloped brackets out and the offending terms appear:

```math
\underbrace{\delta_{i,2}\,\alpha_{i,1} v_i}_{\text{bilinear}} \qquad\text{and}\qquad
\underbrace{\delta_{i,4}\,\alpha_{i,2} v_i}_{\text{bilinear}}
```

Each is a **product of two decision variables**: one binary, one continuous. Everything
else in the expression is a variable times a constant. So the whole difficulty of the
Big-M formulation reduces to these two products, and if they can be removed the model
becomes a plain MILP.

**Step 4: remove the two products, exactly.** The saving grace is that ``\delta_{i,b}`` is
binary rather than merely continuous, and ``v_i`` is bounded. Under those two conditions
each product can be replaced by a new continuous variable ``W_{i,b} := \delta_{i,b} v_i``
and four linear inequalities, with **no approximation whatsoever**:

```math
-M(1-\delta_{i,b}) \;\le\; v_i - W_{i,b} \;\le\; M(1-\delta_{i,b}), \qquad
V^{\text{bp}}_{b}\,\delta_{i,b} \;\le\; W_{i,b} \;\le\; V^{\text{bp}}_{b+1}\,\delta_{i,b} . \tag{5}
```

Check the two cases and the exactness is immediate. If ``\delta_{i,b} = 1``, the left pair
forces ``W_{i,b} = v_i`` and the right pair confines ``v_i`` to the segment. If
``\delta_{i,b} = 0``, the right pair forces ``W_{i,b} = 0`` (both bounds collapse to zero)
while the left pair goes slack. Either way ``W_{i,b}`` equals ``\delta_{i,b} v_i`` exactly:
this is a reformulation, not a relaxation.

Only segments 2 and 4 need this treatment, and for those the ``W_{i,b}`` bounds already pin
``v_i`` into the segment, so their Step-2 window rows are replaced rather than added to.
The complete constraint system for the Big-M droop is therefore:

```math
\begin{aligned}
-(1-\delta_{i,1})M + V^{l}\;\; &\le v_i \le\; V^{\text{bp}}_{2} + (1-\delta_{i,1})M\\[2pt]
-M(1-\delta_{i,2}) \;&\le\; v_i - W_{i,2} \;\le\; (1-\delta_{i,2})M\\
V^{\text{bp}}_{2}\,\delta_{i,2} \;&\le\; W_{i,2} \;\le\; V^{\text{bp}}_{3}\,\delta_{i,2}\\[2pt]
-(1-\delta_{i,3})M + V^{\text{bp}}_{3} &\le v_i \le\; V^{\text{bp}}_{4} + (1-\delta_{i,3})M\\[2pt]
-M(1-\delta_{i,4}) \;&\le\; v_i - W_{i,4} \;\le\; (1-\delta_{i,4})M\\
V^{\text{bp}}_{4}\,\delta_{i,4} \;&\le\; W_{i,4} \;\le\; V^{\text{bp}}_{5}\,\delta_{i,4}\\[2pt]
-(1-\delta_{i,5})M + V^{\text{bp}}_{5} &\le v_i \le\; V^{u} + (1-\delta_{i,5})M
\end{aligned} \tag{6}
```

Read alongside the Step-2 system, the change is visible: rows 2 and 4, the sloped
segments, have each become a ``W`` definition plus a ``W`` range, while the three flat
segments keep their original windows unchanged.

Now substitute ``\delta_{i,2} v_i \to W_{i,2}`` and ``\delta_{i,4} v_i \to W_{i,4}`` in the
Step 3 expression. Nothing else changes, and the droop law becomes a single **linear**
equation in which every coefficient is a constant:

```math
q_i^G = \delta_{i,1}\bar q_i
      + \alpha_{i,1} W_{i,2} + \delta_{i,2}\frac{\bar q_i V^{\text{bp}}_3}{V^{\text{bp}}_3 - V^{\text{bp}}_2}
      + \alpha_{i,2} W_{i,4} + \delta_{i,4}\frac{\bar q_i V^{\text{bp}}_4}{V^{\text{bp}}_5 - V^{\text{bp}}_4}
      - \delta_{i,5}\bar q_i,
\qquad \forall i \in \mathcal{G} \tag{7}
```

Compare it with the Step 3 version: the two bracketed sloped terms have simply been split
into a ``W`` term and a ``\delta`` term. That substitution is the entire content of the
Big-M droop model.

In JuMP, with `npv` inverters and `T` time steps, and `vpv(i, t)` the sensing map of the
previous section:

```julia
Mbig = 1.1
@variable(model, δ[1:5, 1:npv, 1:T], Bin)
@variable(model, W2[1:npv, 1:T])
@variable(model, W4[1:npv, 1:T])

@constraint(model, [i in 1:npv, t in 1:T], sum(δ[j, i, t] for j in 1:5) == 1)

# flat segments 1, 3, 5: the binary only switches on a voltage window
for (j, lo, hi) in ((1, 1, 2), (3, 3, 4), (5, 5, 6))
    @constraint(model, [i in 1:npv, t in 1:T], vpv(i,t) >= VBP[lo] - Mbig * (1 - δ[j,i,t]))
    @constraint(model, [i in 1:npv, t in 1:T], vpv(i,t) <= VBP[hi] + Mbig * (1 - δ[j,i,t]))
end

# sloped segments 2 and 4: W = δ·v, whose bounds double as the window
for (j, W, lo, hi) in ((2, W2, 2, 3), (4, W4, 4, 5))
    @constraint(model, [i in 1:npv, t in 1:T], vpv(i,t) - W[i,t] >= -Mbig * (1 - δ[j,i,t]))
    @constraint(model, [i in 1:npv, t in 1:T], vpv(i,t) - W[i,t] <=  Mbig * (1 - δ[j,i,t]))
    @constraint(model, [i in 1:npv, t in 1:T], W[i,t] >= VBP[lo] * δ[j,i,t])
    @constraint(model, [i in 1:npv, t in 1:T], W[i,t] <= VBP[hi] * δ[j,i,t])
end

# the droop law itself, eq. (7)
@constraint(model, [i in 1:npv, t in 1:T],
    Qdg[i,t] == δ[1,i,t] * PV[i].Smax
              + W2[i,t] * (-PV[i].Smax / (VBP[3] - VBP[2]))
              + δ[2,i,t] * (PV[i].Smax * VBP[3] / (VBP[3] - VBP[2]))
              + W4[i,t] * (-PV[i].Smax / (VBP[5] - VBP[4]))
              + δ[4,i,t] * (PV[i].Smax * VBP[4] / (VBP[5] - VBP[4]))
              - δ[5,i,t] * PV[i].Smax)
```

`PV[i].Smax` is inverter ``i``'s reactive capability ``\bar q_i``, and `vpv(i,t)` is the
only line in the block that knows the network is three-phase.

!!! tip "Choose M as tightly as you can justify"
    ``M`` only has to dominate the largest possible violation of a deactivated
    constraint, which here is set by the voltage bounds. A needlessly large ``M`` leaves
    the LP relaxation loose, the branch-and-bound tree deep, and the solve slow. The
    value used here is `1.1`.

The cost of exactness is bookkeeping: five binaries per inverter per time step, plus two
auxiliary continuous variables. On the twelve-inverter, 96-step case study that is 5760
binaries and 2304 auxiliary continuous variables, and both counts grow with the fleet.

## Method B — Lambda / SOS2

*Following Inaolaji, Savasci and Paudyal [[6]](#ref-6) and its three-phase extension [[7]](#ref-7), which
apply the classical lambda method to Volt-VAr and Volt-Watt droops on a LinDistFlow
host; see also Chapter 5 of [[9]](#ref-9).*

**The idea in one sentence.** Instead of asking *which segment am I on*, describe the
operating point directly as a blend of two neighbouring breakpoints.

Big-M starts from the case distinction and works to make it linear. Lambda never forms
the case distinction at all. It uses a fact about piecewise-linear curves: **every point
on the curve is a weighted average of two adjacent breakpoints**, and nothing else is.

So attach a weight ``\lambda_{i,b} \ge 0`` to each of the six breakpoints of inverter
``i``, make the weights sum to one, and build *both* coordinates from the same weights.
Written once with the phase visible,

```math
v_{b(i)}^{\varphi(i)} = \sum_{b=1}^{6}\lambda_{i,b} V^{\text{bp}}_b,
```

and then, with ``v_i`` for that same quantity,

```math
v_i = \sum_{b=1}^{6}\lambda_{i,b} V^{\text{bp}}_b, \qquad
q_i^G = \sum_{b=1}^{6}\lambda_{i,b}\, q^{\text{bp}}_{i,b}, \qquad
\sum_{b=1}^{6}\lambda_{i,b} = 1, \qquad \lambda_{i,b} \ge 0 . \tag{8}
```

The single shared ``\lambda`` is the whole trick. Because one set of weights generates
the voltage *and* the reactive power, the pair ``(v_i, q_i^G)`` cannot drift off the
curve: move the weights and both coordinates slide together along it. Both
``V^{\text{bp}}_b`` and the ordinates ``q^{\text{bp}}_{i,b} = \bar q_i\,(q/\bar q)_b`` are
constants, so these are ordinary linear constraints, and no ``M`` needs choosing anywhere.
Note that only the ordinates carry the inverter index: the six breakpoint *voltages* are
the utility's setting and are shared by the whole fleet, while the six reactive values are
scaled by each inverter's own capability.

**The catch.** As written, the weights describe the *convex hull* of the six
breakpoints, not the curve. Nothing yet stops the solver putting weight on
``\lambda_{i,1}`` and ``\lambda_{i,5}`` simultaneously, which lands the operating point
somewhere in the interior of that hull, a ``(v, q)`` pair the inverter would never
produce. Since interior points give the optimiser more reactive power at a given voltage
than the real device offers, it will happily take them.

**The fix** is the classical **SOS2** condition: at most two weights may be nonzero, and
they must be *adjacent*. That is exactly the "blend of two neighbouring breakpoints"
statement, imposed rather than hoped for. Introduce one binary ``z_{i,b}`` per segment,
five of them for six breakpoints, and write, in full:

```math
\begin{aligned}
\lambda_{i,1} &\le z_{i,1}\\
\lambda_{i,2} &\le z_{i,1} + z_{i,2}\\
\lambda_{i,3} &\le z_{i,2} + z_{i,3}\\
\lambda_{i,4} &\le z_{i,3} + z_{i,4}\\
\lambda_{i,5} &\le z_{i,4} + z_{i,5}\\
\lambda_{i,6} &\le z_{i,5}\\[2pt]
\sum_{b=1}^{5} z_{i,b} &= 1, \qquad z_{i,b} \in \{0,1\}
\end{aligned} \tag{9}
```

Read it as: ``z_{i,b} = 1`` names the active segment; a weight ``\lambda_{i,b}`` is
allowed to be nonzero only if breakpoint ``b`` is an endpoint of that segment. Since
exactly one ``z_{i,b}`` is 1, precisely two adjacent weights survive and every other weight
is forced to zero. The blend is back on the curve.

Trace one case to see it work. Suppose ``z_{i,3} = 1`` and every other ``z_{i,b} = 0``.
Rows 1, 2 and 6 then force ``\lambda_{i,1} = \lambda_{i,2} = \lambda_{i,6} = 0``; row 5
forces ``\lambda_{i,5} = 0``; and only ``\lambda_{i,3} \le 1`` and ``\lambda_{i,4} \le 1``
survive. With ``\sum_b \lambda_{i,b} = 1`` the operating point is a blend of breakpoints 3
and 4 alone, that is, a point on segment 3, the dead-band.

Collecting everything, the complete Lambda droop model is:

```math
\begin{aligned}
v_i &= \sum_{b=1}^{6}\lambda_{i,b} V^{\text{bp}}_b\\
q_i^G &= \sum_{b=1}^{6}\lambda_{i,b}\, q^{\text{bp}}_{i,b}\\
\sum_{b=1}^{6}\lambda_{i,b} &= 1, \qquad \lambda_{i,b} \ge 0\\
\lambda_{i,1} \le z_{i,1}, \quad \lambda_{i,b} &\le z_{i,b-1} + z_{i,b} \;\;(b=2,\dots,5), \quad \lambda_{i,6} \le z_{i,5}\\
\sum_{b=1}^{5} z_{i,b} &= 1, \qquad z_{i,b} \in \{0,1\}
\end{aligned}
\qquad \forall i \in \mathcal{G} \tag{10}
```

Seven constraint rows and no constant to tune; compare that with the Big-M system above.

Worth noticing what is *absent*: no big-M constant, and no product of a binary with a
continuous variable. The binaries here only switch other variables off, a much
better-behaved use of integrality, and the reason this formulation tends to give tighter
relaxations than Big-M on the same curve.

```julia
@variable(model, λ[1:6, 1:npv, 1:T] >= 0)
@variable(model, z[1:5, 1:npv, 1:T], Bin)

@constraint(model, [i in 1:npv, t in 1:T], sum(λ[j, i, t] for j in 1:6) == 1)
@constraint(model, [i in 1:npv, t in 1:T], sum(z[j, i, t] for j in 1:5) == 1)
@constraint(model, [i in 1:npv, t in 1:T], λ[1, i, t] <= z[1, i, t])
@constraint(model, [j in 2:5, i in 1:npv, t in 1:T], λ[j, i, t] <= z[j-1, i, t] + z[j, i, t])
@constraint(model, [i in 1:npv, t in 1:T], λ[6, i, t] <= z[5, i, t])

# the two coordinates, built from the same weights
@constraint(model, [i in 1:npv, t in 1:T], vpv(i, t) == sum(λ[j,i,t] * VBP[j] for j in 1:6))
@constraint(model, [i in 1:npv, t in 1:T],
    Qdg[i, t] == sum(λ[j,i,t] * QSHAPE[j] * PV[i].Smax for j in 1:6))
```

`QSHAPE` is the normalised ordinate vector ``(1, 1, 0, 0, -1, -1)`` of Table 1, and
multiplying it by `PV[i].Smax` is what gives each size class its own curve. As in Big-M,
`vpv(i, t)` is the only three-phase line in the block.

!!! note "SOS2 without the binaries"
    Most MILP solvers support SOS2 natively via `MOI.SOS2`, which lets the solver
    branch on the set directly instead of on explicit binaries. The formulation above is
    written out longhand because it is portable and because it makes the logic visible,
    which is the point of a tutorial.

The Lambda form has a decisive practical advantage over Big-M once you stop treating the
curve as fixed. The breakpoint voltages ``V^{\text{bp}}_b`` appear *linearly* here, and in
only one place. Make them decision variables, so the DOPF chooses the curve as well as
the dispatch, and exactly one product turns bilinear:

```math
v_i = \sum_{b=1}^{6}\lambda_{i,b} V^{\text{bp}}_b \tag{11}
```

A single, well-understood bilinear term, routinely handled by a McCormick envelope and
tightened by partitioning the breakpoint range if the relaxation is too loose. The
reactive equation ``q_i^G = \sum_b \lambda_{i,b} q^{\text{bp}}_{i,b}`` is untouched, since
the ordinates stay constant.

Big-M remains exact under the same change (nothing about it stops representing the
curve), but the nonlinearity it acquires is both more widespread and of a worse kind. The
slopes ``\alpha_{i,1} = -\bar q_i/(V^{\text{bp}}_3 - V^{\text{bp}}_2)`` and ``\alpha_{i,2}``
become *rational functions* of the breakpoints, so in the droop law the terms
``\alpha_{i,1} W_{i,2} + \delta_{i,2}\,\bar q_i V^{\text{bp}}_3/(V^{\text{bp}}_3 - V^{\text{bp}}_2)``
and their segment-4 counterparts are nonlinear in ``V^{\text{bp}}`` rather than merely
bilinear; and the segment bounds
``V^{\text{bp}}_b \delta_{i,b} \le W_{i,b} \le V^{\text{bp}}_{b+1}\delta_{i,b}`` pick up
further products of breakpoints with binaries. Lambda confines the whole difficulty to one
term; Big-M spreads it across the droop law *and* the bounds. That is why work on
optimised and adaptive droop curves is normally built on Lambda [[8]](#ref-8),
[[11]](#ref-11).

The bookkeeping matches Big-M's binary count and exceeds its continuous one: five binaries
and six weights per inverter per time step, so 5760 binaries and 6912 weights on the case
study below.

## Method C — Heaviside

*Following Inaolaji, Savasci and Paudyal [[10]](#ref-10), which introduced this encoding precisely
to remove the integer variables from the two formulations above, on a
current-voltage DOPF host of the same family used here; see also Chapter 6 of [[9]](#ref-9).*

**The idea in one sentence.** Keep the case distinction, but write it as arithmetic
instead of logic, so there is nothing for a solver to branch on.

Both previous methods spend integer variables to answer "which segment?". Integers are
what make a model combinatorial: the count grows with inverters × time steps, and
branch-and-bound has to search over them. On an unbalanced LV feeder that product is the
whole problem, because the fleet is made of single-phase devices and there can be one at
every service connection. The motivation in [[10]](#ref-10) is to get rid of the integers
altogether, which also makes the model a candidate for real-time use.

The observation is that an "if" is just an on/off switch, and the unit step *is* an
on/off switch written as a function:

```math
H(x) = \begin{cases} 1, & x \ge 0\\ 0, & x < 0\end{cases} \tag{12}
```

Shift it to flip at a breakpoint and subtract two of them, and you get a **window** that
equals 1 on one segment and 0 everywhere else:

```math
\mathcal{W}_{i,b} \;=\; H\!\left(v_i - V^{\text{bp}}_{b}\right) - H\!\left(v_i - V^{\text{bp}}_{b+1}\right),
\qquad v_i = v_{b(i)}^{\varphi(i)} \tag{13}
```

which is precisely the condition ``V^{\text{bp}}_b \le v_i \le V^{\text{bp}}_{b+1}``: the
if-else of segment ``b``, written without logic and without binaries. Multiply each
segment's law by its own window and add them up. The windows are disjoint, so at any
voltage all but one vanish and the sum collapses to the single active law.

Written out with every window expanded, and with all five segments present so the
structure is visible:

```math
\begin{aligned}
q_i^G \;=\; &\;\;\;\;\bar q_i \big[\,H(v_i - V^{\text{bp}}_1) - H(v_i - V^{\text{bp}}_2)\,\big] \;+\\
&\;\alpha_{i,1}\!\left(v_i - V^{\text{bp}}_3\right)\big[\,H(v_i - V^{\text{bp}}_2) - H(v_i - V^{\text{bp}}_3)\,\big] \;+\\
&\;\;\;\;0\,\big[\,H(v_i - V^{\text{bp}}_3) - H(v_i - V^{\text{bp}}_4)\,\big] \;+\\
&\;\alpha_{i,2}\!\left(v_i - V^{\text{bp}}_4\right)\big[\,H(v_i - V^{\text{bp}}_4) - H(v_i - V^{\text{bp}}_5)\,\big] \;-\\
&\;\;\;\;\bar q_i \big[\,H(v_i - V^{\text{bp}}_5) - H(v_i - V^{\text{bp}}_6)\,\big]
\end{aligned}
\qquad \forall i \in \mathcal{G} \tag{14}
```

with the same slopes as before,
``\alpha_{i,1} = -\bar q_i/(V^{\text{bp}}_3-V^{\text{bp}}_2)`` and
``\alpha_{i,2} = -\bar q_i/(V^{\text{bp}}_5-V^{\text{bp}}_4)``.

That is the entire droop model: one equation per inverter per time step, no auxiliary
variables, no constraint system to accompany it. Line 3 is written out only for symmetry;
being identically zero, it is dropped in the implementation.

!!! tip "Anchor each sloped term at its zero crossing"
    This is the one place where it is easy to get the algebra wrong, so it is worth
    stating explicitly. A sloped term is written ``\alpha(v_i - V^{\ast})`` where
    ``V^{\ast}`` is the voltage at which *that segment's* reactive output passes through
    zero, namely ``V^{\text{bp}}_3`` for segment 2 and ``V^{\text{bp}}_4`` for segment 4.

    Anchoring anywhere else breaks the curve. Anchor segment 2 at ``V^{\text{bp}}_2``
    instead, for example, and the term evaluates to ``0`` at ``V^{\text{bp}}_2`` where the
    curve should read ``\bar q_i``, leaving a jump at the breakpoint. With the anchors
    above, segment 2 gives ``\bar q_i`` at ``V^{\text{bp}}_2`` and ``0`` at
    ``V^{\text{bp}}_3``, matching the flat segments it joins on either side. The
    verification section below is what confirms this came out right.

```julia
Hstep(x) = op_ifelse(op_greater_than_or_equal_to(x, 0), 1.0, 0.0)

@constraint(model, [i in 1:npv, t in 1:T],
    Qdg[i,t] ==
        PV[i].Smax * (Hstep(vpv(i,t) - VBP[1]) - Hstep(vpv(i,t) - VBP[2]))
      + (-PV[i].Smax / (VBP[3] - VBP[2])) * (vpv(i,t) - VBP[3]) *
            (Hstep(vpv(i,t) - VBP[2]) - Hstep(vpv(i,t) - VBP[3]))
      + (-PV[i].Smax / (VBP[5] - VBP[4])) * (vpv(i,t) - VBP[4]) *
            (Hstep(vpv(i,t) - VBP[4]) - Hstep(vpv(i,t) - VBP[5]))
      - PV[i].Smax * (Hstep(vpv(i,t) - VBP[5]) - Hstep(vpv(i,t) - VBP[6])))
```

`op_ifelse` and `op_greater_than_or_equal_to` are JuMP's nonlinear operators
(JuMP ≥ 1.15); they build the expression correctly outside a macro.

No extra variables at all, just one algebraic expression per inverter per time step. The
price is paid in solver behaviour. ``H(\cdot)`` is discontinuous, so the derivative is
undefined at every breakpoint and the problem is non-convex. Two consequences follow: the
model needs an NLP solver rather than an MILP one, and the non-smoothness is expensive to
differentiate, which makes this the slowest of the three encodings on the case study and
the first to break down as the network grows. [Does it scale?](@ref) puts numbers on both.

## The three-phase hosts

The droop needs a host, and this tutorial provides two, deliberately, because the pair
makes the separation between *encoding* and *host* measurable rather than merely asserted:

**Table 3.** The two three-phase hosts, and the script family implementing each.

| script family | model | class | solve |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| `LinDist3Flow_*.jl` | **LinDist3Flow**: multiphase linearised branch flow [[12]](#ref-12) | linear approximation | one pass |
| `IVACOPF3Ph_*.jl` | **IVACOPF**: three-phase current-voltage AC-OPF [[4]](#ref-4) | near-exact AC | successive linearisation, iterated |

Both are set out in full below, briefly, because the subject of this page is the droop
rather than the network model, and both carry the three droop blocks just written, the
same feeder, the same fleet and the same objective.

### The inverter model, shared by both hosts

Everything that is *shared* between the two hosts is stated once here. Inverter ``i`` sits
at bus ``b(i)`` on phase ``\varphi(i)``, carries an array whose available output
``\bar p_i(t)`` follows the irradiance profile, and an inverter rated ``S_i^{\max}``:

```math
\begin{aligned}
p_i^{G} &\le \bar p_i(t) & &\text{irradiance ceiling}\\
p_i^{\mathrm{curt}} &= \bar p_i(t) - p_i^{G} \;\ge\; 0 & &\text{curtailment}\\
\cos\theta_l\; p_i^{G} + \sin\theta_l\; q_i^{G} &\in [-S_i^{\max},\, S_i^{\max}],
   \quad \theta_l = \tfrac{l\pi}{16},\; l = 1,\dots,16 & &\text{capability polygon}\\
q_i^{G} &= q_i\!\left(v_{b(i)}^{\varphi(i)}\right) & &\text{the droop}\\[2pt]
\min \; & \textstyle\sum_{i \in \mathcal{G}} \sum_{t} p_i^{\mathrm{curt}} & &\text{objective}
\end{aligned} \tag{15}
```

Three of those five lines are worth a sentence each.

**The capability polygon.** The real constraint is
``(p_i^{G})^2 + (q_i^{G})^2 \le (S_i^{\max})^2``, a circle: convex, but nonlinear, and a
quadratic constraint would cost the model its MILP class. Following [[6]](#ref-6) it is
replaced by an inscribed ``2k``-sided polygon, exactly ``2k`` linear constraints that
tighten as ``k`` grows, with ``k = 16`` here for a 32-vertex polygon. Being *inscribed*, it
is conservative: every point it admits is inside the real circle.

**The droop, and what is not in the objective.** ``q_i^{G}`` never appears in the objective
function. It is pinned entirely by the fourth line, the curve, encoded exactly by Big-M,
Lambda/SOS2 or Heaviside. That is precisely the point of the whole page: the optimiser
cannot buy voltage support by choosing reactive power freely, it can only choose active
power and live with the reactive response the curve produces at whatever voltage results.

**The one scalar the host must supply.** ``v_{b(i)}^{\varphi(i)}`` is the entire interface
between the two halves of the model. Everything the two hosts below disagree about reduces
to what they predict for that number.

### LinDist3Flow: the linear host

The multiphase form of the LinDistFlow linearisation [[3]](#ref-3) of the Baran and Wu
branch-flow model [[2]](#ref-2), from Sankur, Dobbe, Stewart, Callaway and Arnold
[[12]](#ref-12). Each line carries a 3×3 phase impedance ``Z`` rather than a scalar and
the phases couple, so a scalar ``rP + xQ`` drop no longer suffices.

That paper writes KVL and KCL in three-phase vector form and derives the exact
**Dist3Flow** equations, Eqs. (14)–(17) of [[12]](#ref-12). Two things in them are
nonlinear: the loss terms, and the *ratio of voltages between phases* at a node,
``\gamma_n^{\varphi\psi} = V_n^{\varphi}/V_n^{\psi}``, which scales and rotates the
off-diagonal impedances. **LinDist3Flow is what follows from holding both constant**, under the
paper's assumptions **A1** (``\gamma`` constant) and **A2** (loss terms constant). Fixing
``\gamma`` at its nominal value, ``1\angle{\pm}120^{\circ}``, and dropping losses
altogether gives Eqs. (20)–(23) of [[12]](#ref-12), the model used here. Per phase
``\varphi``:

```math
w_j^{\varphi} = w_i^{\varphi} - \sum_{\psi} \Big( a^R_{\varphi\psi} P_{ij}^{\psi}
                                               + a^X_{\varphi\psi} Q_{ij}^{\psi} \Big),
\qquad
\begin{aligned}
a^R_{\varphi\psi} &= 2\,\mathrm{Re}\!\left(\alpha^{\psi-\varphi} Z_{\varphi\psi}\right)\\
a^X_{\varphi\psi} &= 2\,\mathrm{Im}\!\left(\alpha^{\psi-\varphi} Z_{\varphi\psi}\right)
\end{aligned} \tag{16}
```

with ``w = \lvert V\rvert^2`` the squared voltage magnitude and ``\alpha = e^{-j2\pi/3}``
the 120° rotation. This is Eq. (21) of [[12]](#ref-12). Writing the rotation out term by
term recovers its coefficient matrices, Eqs. (22)–(23), exactly, with
``a^R = -\mathbb{M}^P`` and ``a^X = -\mathbb{M}^Q``:

```math
a^R_{ij} =
\begin{bmatrix}
 2r^{aa} & -r^{ab}+\sqrt{3}\,x^{ab} & -r^{ac}-\sqrt{3}\,x^{ac}\\
-r^{ba}-\sqrt{3}\,x^{ba} &  2r^{bb} & -r^{bc}+\sqrt{3}\,x^{bc}\\
-r^{ca}+\sqrt{3}\,x^{ca} & -r^{cb}-\sqrt{3}\,x^{cb} &  2r^{cc}
\end{bmatrix} \tag{17}
```

and ``a^X`` identically, with ``r`` and ``x`` exchanged and the sign of every
``\sqrt{3}`` term flipped. Those ``\pm\sqrt{3}`` cross-terms are the ``120^{\circ}``
rotation written out, and they are what makes this a *three-phase* model rather than three
single-phase ones running side by side. Two checks are worth carrying: for a single phase
``\alpha^0 = 1`` gives ``a^R = 2r`` and ``a^X = 2x``, recovering
``w_j = w_i - 2(rP + xQ)``; and for diagonal ``Z`` the matrices are diagonal and the
phases decouple into three independent LinDistFlows.

The implementation works in magnitude rather than squared magnitude
(``w_j - w_i \approx 2 V^{\mathrm{nom}}(v_j - v_i)`` near nominal) so that the droop
breakpoints stay in ordinary p.u. voltage. That done, the complete host is four
equations: the lossless power balance per bus *and* per phase, which is Eq. (20) of
[[12]](#ref-12), the coupled drop above, the slack, and the voltage limits its DOPF,
Eq. (24), imposes:

```math
\begin{aligned}
v_0^{\varphi} &= V^{\mathrm{nom}} & &\forall \varphi \in \Psi\\
p_j^{G,\varphi} - p_j^{L,\varphi} &= \sum_{k:(j,k)\in\mathcal{L}} P_{jk}^{\varphi}
                                   - \sum_{i:(i,j)\in\mathcal{L}} P_{ij}^{\varphi}
                                   & &\forall j \in \mathcal{B},\ \varphi \in \Psi\\
q_j^{G,\varphi} - q_j^{L,\varphi} &= \sum_{k:(j,k)\in\mathcal{L}} Q_{jk}^{\varphi}
                                   - \sum_{i:(i,j)\in\mathcal{L}} Q_{ij}^{\varphi}
                                   & &\forall j \in \mathcal{B},\ \varphi \in \Psi\\
v_j^{\varphi} &= v_i^{\varphi} - \sum_{\psi \in \Psi} \Big( \tilde a^R_{\varphi\psi} P_{ij}^{\psi}
                                       + \tilde a^X_{\varphi\psi} Q_{ij}^{\psi} \Big)
                                   & &\forall (i,j) \in \mathcal{L},\ \varphi \in \Psi\\
V^{\min} &\le v_j^{\varphi} \le V^{\max} & &\forall j \in \mathcal{B},\ \varphi \in \Psi
\end{aligned} \tag{18}
```

with ``\Psi = \{a,b,c\}`` the phase set, ``\varphi`` and ``\psi`` phases within it, and
``\tilde a = a / (2V^{\mathrm{nom}})`` the magnitude-form coefficients. Note what is
*absent*: there is no current variable and no loss term. That is exactly what buys the
linearity, and exactly what it costs.

```julia
# 3×3 drop coefficients, once per line
const ALPHA = exp(-2π * im / 3)
function drop_matrices(Z)                      # Z is 3×3, per unit
    aR = zeros(3, 3); aX = zeros(3, 3)
    for p in 1:3, q in 1:3
        c = ALPHA^(p - q) * conj(Z[p, q])
        aR[p, q] = 2 * real(c); aX[p, q] = -2 * imag(c)
    end
    return aR ./ (2 * VNOM), aX ./ (2 * VNOM)    # magnitude form
end

                   - sum(P[k, φ, t] for k in in_br[b];  init = zero(AffExpr)))
@constraint(model, [b in 1:nb, φ in PHASES, t in 1:T],
    netQ[b, φ, t] == sum(Q[k, φ, t] for k in out_br[b]; init = zero(AffExpr))
                   - sum(Q[k, φ, t] for k in in_br[b];  init = zero(AffExpr)))
```

where `netP`/`netQ` collect the substation injection, the inverters at that bus and phase,
and the local load.

### Three-phase IVACOPF: the near-exact host

The **current-voltage AC optimal power flow** of Soltani, Khorsand and Ma [[4]](#ref-4),
in its native three-phase unbalanced form, the setting [[4]](#ref-4) was written for. Its
appeal here is structural. Write the network in rectangular current and voltage
coordinates and the *line* equations become exactly linear, mutual coupling and all; the
only nonlinearity left is the ``v \cdot I`` power balance and the voltage magnitude, and
both live at the **buses**. In a distribution feeder the buses are the endpoints and the
lines are everything else, so this confines the nonlinearity to a small, well-behaved part
of the model instead of spreading it along every branch, as a power-voltage formulation
does.

The formulation is that of Soltani, Khorsand and Ma [[4]](#ref-4); the equations are
numbered here in this tutorial's own sequence. Bus set ``\Upsilon``, phase set
``\Psi = \{a,b,c\}`` with phases indexed ``\varphi`` and ``p``; the time index
``t \in \{1,\dots,96\}`` is suppressed throughout.

**Line current constraints.** For the line from ``n`` to ``m``, with 3×3
impedance ``Z_{nm}^{\varphi p} = R_{nm}^{\varphi p} + jX_{nm}^{\varphi p}`` and shunt
admittance ``y_{nm}^{p,k}``:

```math
V_n^{\varphi} - V_m^{\varphi} = \sum_{p\in\Psi} Z_{nm}^{\varphi p} I_{nm}^{p}
   \;-\; \tfrac{1}{2}\sum_{p\in\Psi} Z_{nm}^{\varphi p}
          \Big( \sum_{k\in\Psi} y_{nm}^{p,k} V_n^{k} \Big),
\qquad \forall \varphi \in \Psi \tag{19}
```

Three physical contributions, in two sums: the current in the same phase (the ``p = \varphi``
term), the currents in the *other* phases reaching this one through the mutual impedances,
and the shunt current. Splitting (19) into real and imaginary parts gives, for the
Kron-reduced three-wire feeders used here, where ``y = 0``,

```math
\begin{aligned}
v_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi} - v_m^{\mathrm{re},\varphi}
  &= \sum_{p\in\Psi}\Big( R_{nm}^{\varphi p} I_{nm}^{\mathrm{re},p}
                        - X_{nm}^{\varphi p} I_{nm}^{\mathrm{im},p} \Big)\\
v_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi} - v_m^{\mathrm{im},\varphi}
  &= \sum_{p\in\Psi}\Big( R_{nm}^{\varphi p} I_{nm}^{\mathrm{im},p}
                        + X_{nm}^{\varphi p} I_{nm}^{\mathrm{re},p} \Big)
\end{aligned}
\qquad \forall (n,m) \in \mathcal{L},\ \varphi \in \Psi \tag{20}
```

These are **exact and linear**. No rotation operator appears, nothing is transposed, and
no near-balance is assumed anywhere; compare the ``\alpha^{\psi-\varphi}`` of
LinDist3Flow, which is precisely where that host's balanced-voltage assumption enters.

**Bus current injection**, KCL per bus and phase, also exact and linear:

```math
I_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi} = \sum_{m:(n,m)\in\mathcal{L}} I_{nm}^{\mathrm{re},\varphi}
                          - \sum_{k:(k,n)\in\mathcal{L}} I_{kn}^{\mathrm{re},\varphi},
\qquad
I_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi} = \sum_{m:(n,m)\in\mathcal{L}} I_{nm}^{\mathrm{im},\varphi}
                          - \sum_{k:(k,n)\in\mathcal{L}} I_{kn}^{\mathrm{im},\varphi} \tag{21}
```

**Power balance**, the first of the two nonlinear relations:

```math
\begin{aligned}
p_n^{G,\varphi} - p_n^{L,\varphi}
   &= v_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi} I_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi}
    + v_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi} I_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi}\\
q_n^{G,\varphi} - q_n^{L,\varphi}
   &= v_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi} I_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi}
    - v_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi} I_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi}
\end{aligned}
\qquad \forall n \in \Upsilon,\ \varphi \in \Psi \tag{22}
```

**Linearised power balance.** Each product ``xy`` in (37) is replaced by its first-order
Taylor expansion about the previous iterate, ``xy \approx x^{\circ}y + y^{\circ}x -
x^{\circ}y^{\circ}``, where ``\circ`` marks a value **fixed from the previous pass**, a
constant, not a variable:

```math
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{P}_n^{\varphi} &:= v_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi\circ} I_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi}
   + I_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi\circ} v_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi}
   + v_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi\circ} I_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi}
   + I_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi\circ} v_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi}
   - v_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi\circ} I_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi\circ}
   - v_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi\circ} I_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi\circ}\\
\mathcal{Q}_n^{\varphi} &:= v_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi\circ} I_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi}
   + I_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi\circ} v_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi}
   - v_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi\circ} I_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi}
   - I_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi\circ} v_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi}
   - v_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi\circ} I_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi\circ}
   + v_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi\circ} I_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi\circ}
\end{aligned} \tag{23}
```

which are then set equal to the net injection at each class of bus:

```math
\begin{aligned}
p_0^{\mathrm{grid},\varphi} &= \mathcal{P}_0^{\varphi}, &
q_0^{\mathrm{grid},\varphi} &= \mathcal{Q}_0^{\varphi} & &\text{substation}\\
-p_n^{L,\varphi} &= \mathcal{P}_n^{\varphi}, &
-q_n^{L,\varphi} &= \mathcal{Q}_n^{\varphi} & &\text{load-only bus and phase}\\
p_i^{G} - p_n^{L,\varphi} &= \mathcal{P}_n^{\varphi}, &
q_i^{G} - q_n^{L,\varphi} &= \mathcal{Q}_n^{\varphi} & &\text{inverter } i \text{ at } (n,\varphi)
\end{aligned} \tag{24}
```

The last line is where the droop enters the network: ``q_i^{G}`` is exactly the variable
the three encodings constrain.

**Voltage magnitude, and its linearisation**, the second nonlinear relation and the
single quantity the droop module reads:

```math
v_n^{\varphi} = \sqrt{\big(v_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi}\big)^2 + \big(v_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi}\big)^2}
\;\;\longrightarrow\;\;
v_n^{\varphi} = \frac{v_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi\circ}}
   {\sqrt{\big(v_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi\circ}\big)^2 + \big(v_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi\circ}\big)^2}}\, v_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi}
 + \frac{v_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi\circ}}
   {\sqrt{\big(v_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi\circ}\big)^2 + \big(v_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi\circ}\big)^2}}\, v_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi} \tag{25}
```

**Voltage limits.** The band every bus and phase must stay inside:

```math
V^{\min} \le v_n^{\varphi} \le V^{\max},
\qquad \forall n \in \Upsilon,\ \varphi \in \Psi \tag{26}
```

**Thermal line limits.** The conductor rating, per line and phase:

```math
\big(I_{nm}^{\mathrm{re},\varphi}\big)^2 + \big(I_{nm}^{\mathrm{im},\varphi}\big)^2
   \le \big(I_{nm}^{\max,\varphi}\big)^2,
\qquad \forall (n,m) \in \mathcal{L},\ \varphi \in \Psi \tag{27}
```

Constraint (27) is worth pausing on: IVACOPF carries the line current as a decision
variable, so a thermal limit is something you simply *write*. LinDist3Flow has no ``I`` to
write it about. It is quadratic, so the scripts offer it as a polygon inscribing the circle,
which keeps the model an MILP, and leave it off by default, because on these Electricity
North West (ENWL) feeders [[14]](#ref-14), [[15]](#ref-15) the peak flow is about a fifth
of the conductor rating; the loading is reported either way.

**Slack reference.** The three-phase substation, which is also the flat start prescribed
by Soltani, Khorsand and Ma [[4]](#ref-4):

```math
v_0^{\mathrm{re},\varphi} = \cos\theta_{\varphi},\quad
v_0^{\mathrm{im},\varphi} = \sin\theta_{\varphi},
\qquad \theta = (0°,\, -120°,\, +120°) \tag{28}
```

Seeding all three phases at ``1\angle 0°`` instead is a silent and expensive mistake: the
mutual terms then add rather than largely cancelling.

**Convergence.** After each pass, the linearisation error is measured against the *true*
nonlinear relations, not against the model's own residual. Following [[4]](#ref-4), three
metrics are used: the **maximum absolute active power balance** error (MAPB), the
**maximum absolute reactive power balance** error (MRPB), and the **maximum
voltage-magnitude** error (MVM). Writing (22) minus (23) and (25) exact minus linearised,

```math
\begin{aligned}
\text{MAPB} &= \max_{n\in\Upsilon,\,\varphi\in\Psi}
   \Big| \big(v_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi} I_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi}

         - \mathcal{P}_n^{\varphi} \Big|\\
\text{MRPB} &= \max_{n\in\Upsilon,\,\varphi\in\Psi}
   \Big| \big(v_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi} I_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi}
            - v_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi} I_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi}\big)

\text{MVM} &= \max_{n\in\Upsilon,\,\varphi\in\Psi}
   \Big| \sqrt{\big(v_n^{\mathrm{re},\varphi}\big)^2 + \big(v_n^{\mathrm{im},\varphi}\big)^2}
         - v_n^{\varphi} \Big|
\end{aligned} \tag{29}
```

the loop repeats with a refreshed ``\circ`` point until
``\max(\text{MAPB}, \text{MRPB}, \text{MVM}) < \epsilon``, here ``10^{-6}``. Checking
against the true relations is what makes the converged point a genuine power-flow solution
rather than a solution of the approximation, and the audit further down confirms it
independently.

```

#### Where the linearisation loop starts

A flat start (``1\angle0°,\,1\angle{-120°},\,1\angle{+120°}`` with all currents zero) is
what Soltani, Khorsand and Ma [[4]](#ref-4) prescribe, and what the scripts fall back to
with `TP_WARMSTART=flat`. By
default they do something cheaper to converge from: one exact three-phase
backward/forward sweep per time step, at full PV and zero VArs, which costs a few seconds
and hands the first linearisation a physically consistent state instead of a guess. The
principle is worth stating on its own: a cheap, physically consistent starting point buys
passes off the outer loop, and the same sweep is reused afterwards to audit the answer.

## The three-phase case study

The case study puts twelve inverters on `network_5_Feeder_2` [[14]](#ref-14), a real
unbalanced low-voltage (LV) feeder with 194 buses and eighteen single-phase loads split four,
five and nine across the phases, in **four size classes**. Because ``\bar q_i = S_i^{\max}``,
the four classes follow four *different* droop curves: same breakpoint voltages, four
saturation levels. Each phase carries one inverter of each class, 84 kW of array in total,
over a full day at 15-minute resolution, ``T = 96`` time steps. Bus voltages are limited to
``[0.95, 1.05]`` p.u. on every phase, and the objective is to **minimise total PV
curtailment** over the day.

**Table 4.** The four inverter size classes of the case study on `network_5_Feeder_2` [[14]](#ref-14). Because ``\bar q_i = S_i^{\max}``, each class follows a different droop curve.

```@example tut
tp_class_table()   # hide
```

```@example tut
tp_pv_figure()   # hide
```

**Figure 2.** The PV resource across the twelve inverters over the day, and how much of it the droop-constrained dispatch delivers on the IVACOPF host. The gap between the two curves is the objective being minimised: 42.69 kWh of the 476.95 kWh available, or 8.95 %.

Why does a curtailment objective have anything to do with voltage at all? Because the
droop ties the two together. Active power injection raises the local voltage; the droop
reads that voltage and sets reactive power accordingly; and reactive flow moves voltages
across the whole feeder. The optimiser wants every kilowatt it can get; the droop
decides what taking it costs everywhere else.

The phases behave differently, which is the whole reason for modelling them separately:

```@example tut
tp_envelope_figure()   # hide
```

**Figure 3.** Voltage envelope by phase, LinDist3Flow host. The three phases do not coincide, which is the reason for modelling them separately.

```@example tut
tp_envelope_figure("lambda"; res = tpi, host = "IVACOPF")   # hide
```

**Figure 4.** Voltage envelope by phase, IVACOPF host.

The spread between the phases is not a rounding artefact. The loads are split four, five
and nine across them, so the phases carry different currents, sit at different voltages,
and drive their inverters onto different segments of the same curve at the same instant.
Three independent single-phase studies could not produce this picture, and neither could a
balanced three-phase one.

## Verification: does the dispatch actually lie on the curve?

This is the check that matters. Each encoding is exact only if every one of the
``12 \times 96 = 1152`` optimised operating points lands on the droop, on both hosts.

### The droop-deviation metric

Every table on this page that reports a **max droop deviation** reports the same
quantity. Let ``q_i(\cdot)`` be the IEEE 1547 curve of (1), scaled by inverter ``i``'s
reactive capability ``\bar q_i``; let ``q_i^{G}(t)`` be the reactive power the solver
actually dispatched; and let ``v_i(t) = v_{b(i)}^{\varphi(i)}(t)`` be the terminal voltage
that inverter senses, on its own phase. The deviation is the largest gap between the two,
over every inverter and every time step:

```math
\Delta \;=\; \max_{i \in \mathcal{G},\; t}
   \Big\lvert\, q_i^{G}(t) \;-\; q_i\big(v_i(t)\big) \,\Big\rvert \tag{30}
```

It is zero exactly when every dispatch point lies on the curve, so it is the number that
decides whether an encoding is exact. Which voltage is substituted for ``v_i(t)`` changes
what (30) measures, and the two readings are reported separately throughout:

| ``v_i(t)`` taken from | what ``\Delta`` then measures |
|:--|:--|
| the host's own solution | **exactness of the encoding**: does the dispatch satisfy the curve inside the model? |
| an exact three-phase AC power flow on the same dispatch | **accuracy of the host**: would the real inverter have produced that VAr output? |

In code, `droop_q` is (1) written out and the maximum is taken directly. Note the
indexing of `V`: bus, **phase**, time step, which is the only place the three-phase
network enters the check at all.

```julia
droop_q(v, qb) = v <= VBP[2] ? qb :                                        # flat, +q̄
                 v <= VBP[3] ? qb * (VBP[3] - v) / (VBP[3] - VBP[2]) :     # sloped
                 v <= VBP[4] ? 0.0 :                                       # dead-band
                 v <= VBP[5] ? -qb * (v - VBP[4]) / (VBP[5] - VBP[4]) :    # sloped
                               -qb                                          # flat, −q̄

dev = maximum(abs(Qdg_v[i, t] - droop_q(V[PV[i].bus, PV[i].phase, t], PV[i].Smax))
              for i in 1:npv, t in 1:T)
```

Reported values sit between ``10^{-17}`` and ``10^{-6}`` p.u.: solver tolerance, not
model error. A value of ``10^{-3}`` or larger would mean the encoding had failed.

### Every point on its own curve

The curves below are drawn in **absolute p.u. VArs** rather than normalised by
``\bar q_i``. Normalising would collapse the four size classes onto one line and hide the
thing worth seeing: each class has its own reactive capability, so each follows its own
curve, and a dispatch point is only correct if it lies on the curve *of its own
inverter*. The shaded band is the admissible voltage range ``[0.95, 1.05]``.

```@example tut
tp_droop_figure()   # hide
```

**Figure 5.** Three-phase dispatch against the droop, LinDist3Flow host. Four classes, four curves; a point is correct only if it lies on the curve of its own inverter.

```@example tut
tp_droop_figure("lambda"; res = tpi, host = "IVACOPF")   # hide
```

**Figure 6.** The same fleet on the IVACOPF host. The points sit at different places along the curves, because the two hosts predict different terminal voltages, but never off them.

All three encodings put every point on the right curve, to solver tolerance, **on both
hosts**: on a network that is unbalanced, multiphase and carrying a mixed fleet. The
numbers behind these figures are Table 6 below.

Figures 5 and 6 are not identical, and the difference is instructive: the points sit at
different *places along* the curves, because the two hosts predict different terminal
voltages. They are never off the curves. Which set of places is the real one is settled
by the audit in [What the exact power flow says](@ref).

Note also where the operating points sit. Every one of the 1152 falls either in the
dead-band or on the sloped segment just above nominal: the sensed voltages span
``0.992`` to ``1.019`` p.u., so the fleet never drops to ``V^{\text{bp}}_2 = 0.90`` nor
rises to ``V^{\text{bp}}_5 = 1.02``, and the two saturated tails and the lower sloped
segment are never reached. Those segments still have to be in the model, because the
solver must be free to consider them, but they do no work on this feeder. It is a
PV-driven overvoltage problem: the fleet sits inert in the dead-band while the sun is
down, and absorbs on the sloped segment while it is up.

## The two hosts, side by side

Six runs: three encodings on each of two hosts, everything else held fixed.

**Table 5.** Three encodings on each of two three-phase hosts, everything else held fixed. Passes is 1 for the linear host, which has no outer loop.

```@example tut
tp_host_table()   # hide
```

Read Table 5 in two directions. **Down each host block**, the three encodings agree on
curtailment, on losses and on voltage range, which is the empirical statement of the claim
that these are three encodings of one curve. **Across the two blocks**,
the hosts do not agree, and that difference is the network model's alone.

The gap is about 3.6 kWh, some 8 % of the curtailed energy, with LinDist3Flow curtailing
more. Which host curtails more is not a general rule: it depends on the feeder, and the
direction can reverse on another one. What does not depend on the feeder is
the mechanism. LinDist3Flow drops losses from the balance entirely; IVACOPF measures them
at 14.6 kWh over the day, about 3 % of the available PV energy, and having them in the
model changes which dispatch clears the voltage band. A host that cannot represent losses
cannot be expected to agree with one that can, in either direction.

The droop is reproduced exactly in every one of the six:

**Table 6.** Exactness of the encoding within each host: the largest gap between dispatched reactive power and the curve at the voltage that host reports.

```@example tut
tp_exact_table()   # hide
```

That is the separation this section exists to make. **Exactness of the encoding is a
property of the encoding; accuracy is a property of the host.** Every cell above is at
round-off (the inverters sit on their curves *within whatever model they are placed in*),
and Table 6 says nothing whatever about whether that model is right.

## What the exact power flow says

To decide between the hosts you have to stop asking either model about itself. Take each
solved dispatch, put it through an **exact three-phase backward/forward sweep**, and ask
what the inverters would really have seen (Table 7).

Wherever this page compares a dispatch against "the exact AC solution", that sweep
[[13]](#ref-13) is the reference: no linearisation and no balanced-voltage assumption,
iterated per time step to a fixed point for the injections the DOPF returned, with the
full 3×3 line impedances and all mutual coupling retained. It answers a question neither
host can answer about itself, namely what voltage each inverter would actually have
measured on its own phase, and therefore what reactive power the curve would actually have
produced there. The same sweep supplies the IVACOPF warm start, so it is exercised on
every run.

### The exact three-phase backward/forward sweep

The sweep is set out here in the same notation as the two hosts, so that what it assumes,
and what it does not, can be read straight off. The feeder is radial and rooted at the
substation ``0``, so every bus ``m \in \Upsilon \setminus \{0\}`` has exactly one parent
line ``(n,m) \in \mathcal{L}``; write ``\mathcal{C}(m) = \{(m,l) \in \mathcal{L}\}`` for
the lines leaving it. Two things separate this from the hosts above. The dispatch is
**data** here, not a decision: ``p_i^{G}`` and ``q_i^{G}`` are whatever the host returned,
frozen. And nothing is being optimised, so the sweep runs once per time step,
independently, there being no inter-temporal coupling to carry.

**Net injection.** At bus ``n`` and phase ``\varphi`` the load draws and any inverter
sited there injects:

```math
S_n^{\varphi} \;=\;
   \Big(p_n^{L,\varphi} - \!\!\sum_{i \,\in\, \mathcal{G}_n^{\varphi}}\!\! p_i^{G}\Big)
 \;+\; j\Big(q_n^{L,\varphi} - \!\!\sum_{i \,\in\, \mathcal{G}_n^{\varphi}}\!\! q_i^{G}\Big),
\qquad
\mathcal{G}_n^{\varphi} = \big\{\, i \in \mathcal{G} \;:\; b(i) = n,\; \varphi(i) = \varphi \,\big\} \tag{30}
```

A single-phase inverter contributes to one phase of one bus and to nothing else, which is
the same statement the droop interface makes, now read from the network's side.

**Bus current, the one nonlinear relation.** Loads and inverters are constant-power
devices, so the current a bus draws depends on the voltage it finds itself at:

```math
I_n^{\varphi,(k)} \;=\; \left( \frac{S_n^{\varphi}}{V_n^{\varphi,(k)}} \right)^{\!\!*},
\qquad \forall n \in \Upsilon,\ \varphi \in \Psi \tag{31}
```

This is (22) once more, ``S = V I^{*}``, with nothing expanded. IVACOPF has to linearise
that product about a previous iterate, eq. (23), because ``V`` and ``I`` are both decision
variables there; here the state is only being *solved*, so the product stands as written
and the nonlinearity is carried exactly. Note the sign convention: ``I_n^{\varphi}`` in
(31) is the current the bus **draws**, which is what the accumulation below needs, and it
is minus the injection current of (21).

**Backward pass, KCL from the leaves inward.** The current in a line is everything drawn
beyond it:

```math
I_{nm}^{\varphi,(k)} \;=\; I_m^{\varphi,(k)}
   \;+\!\! \sum_{(m,l) \,\in\, \mathcal{C}(m)}\!\! I_{ml}^{\varphi,(k)},
\qquad \forall (n,m) \in \mathcal{L},\ \varphi \in \Psi \tag{32}
```

visiting the buses in reverse depth order, so that every child current on the right has
already been formed in this pass. This is (21) rearranged: on a radial feeder KCL is
solvable by accumulation, with no matrix to factorise and no approximation of any kind.

**Forward pass, Ohm's law with the full 3×3 impedance.** Sweeping outward from the
substation, in depth order this time:

```math
\begin{bmatrix} V_m^{a}\\[2pt] V_m^{b}\\[2pt] V_m^{c}\end{bmatrix}^{(k+1)}
\;=\;
\begin{bmatrix} V_n^{a}\\[2pt] V_n^{b}\\[2pt] V_n^{c}\end{bmatrix}^{(k+1)}
\;-\;
\begin{bmatrix}
Z_{nm}^{aa} & Z_{nm}^{ab} & Z_{nm}^{ac}\\
Z_{nm}^{ba} & Z_{nm}^{bb} & Z_{nm}^{bc}\\
Z_{nm}^{ca} & Z_{nm}^{cb} & Z_{nm}^{cc}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} I_{nm}^{a}\\[2pt] I_{nm}^{b}\\[2pt] I_{nm}^{c}\end{bmatrix}^{(k)},
\qquad \forall (n,m) \in \mathcal{L} \tag{33}
```

the parent voltage on the right being the one this same pass has just produced. Equation
(33) is (19) with the shunt term gone, and gone *exactly* rather than by assumption: both
feeders are Kron-reduced three-wire networks, for which ``y_{nm} = 0``. What is absent
matters more. There is no ``\alpha^{\psi-\varphi}`` rotation, so nothing whatever is
assumed about the balance between phases; the off-diagonal ``Z_{nm}^{\varphi p}`` multiply
the actual currents in the other two phases, whatever those turn out to be. And ``V``
stays complex throughout, so no magnitude linearisation of the kind (25) performs is
needed anywhere.

**Boundary condition.** The substation is held at its three-phase reference on every pass,
which is (28) again:

```math
V_0^{\varphi,(k)} \;=\; e^{j\theta_{\varphi}},
\qquad \theta = (0°,\, -120°,\, +120°),
\qquad \forall k \tag{34}
```

and the same three values, repeated at every bus, are the starting point ``V^{(0)}``.

**Fixed point.** Equations (31) to (33) form a map from ``V^{(k)}`` to ``V^{(k+1)}``,
iterated until it stops moving:

```math
\max_{n\in\Upsilon,\ \varphi\in\Psi}
   \big\lvert\, V_n^{\varphi,(k+1)} - V_n^{\varphi,(k)} \,\big\rvert \;\le\; \epsilon_{\mathrm{pf}} \tag{35}
```

The scripts do not test (35) at all: they run a fixed 60 passes per time step, which on an
LV feeder of this impedance is well past the point where the update falls below double
precision. Write ``V^{\star}`` for the fixed point and
``v_n^{\varphi\star} = \lvert V_n^{\varphi\star} \rvert`` for the magnitudes it implies.
These satisfy (30) to (34) simultaneously and to round-off, which is what the word
*exact* is doing in this section: ``V^{\star}`` is an AC power-flow solution, not an
approximation of one.

**What the sweep deliberately does not carry.** No voltage band (26), no thermal limit
(27), no capability polygon, and above all **no droop**. The reactive powers ``q_i^{G}``
enter (30) as fixed numbers, so nothing in (30) to (35) pushes them back onto the curve.
That is what makes the two numbers below a test rather than a tautology: the curve is
imposed nowhere in the sweep, so any agreement with it has to come from the dispatch
itself.

**The two audit numbers.** Over every bus, phase, inverter and time step of the day,
Table 7 reports

```math
\begin{aligned}
\Delta v &= \max_{n\in\Upsilon,\ \varphi\in\Psi,\ t}
   \big\lvert\, v_n^{\varphi}(t) \;-\; v_n^{\varphi\star}(t) \,\big\rvert
   & &\text{the host's own } v \text{ against the true one}\\[2pt]
\rho^{\mathrm{true}} &= \max_{i\in\mathcal{G},\ t}
   \big\lvert\, q_i^{G}(t) \;-\; q_i\big(v_{b(i)}^{\varphi(i)\star}(t)\big) \,\big\rvert
   & &\text{droop residual at the true voltage}
\end{aligned} \tag{36}
```

where ``v_n^{\varphi}(t)`` is the voltage the host itself reported and ``q_i(\cdot)`` is
that inverter's IEEE 1547 curve, the very map encoded by (7), (10) and (14). Table 6's
column is the same residual measured against the host's own voltage,
``\rho^{\mathrm{model}} = \max_{i,t} \lvert q_i^{G}(t) - q_i(v_i(t)) \rvert``, and the
distance between ``\rho^{\mathrm{model}}`` and ``\rho^{\mathrm{true}}`` is the whole of
what this audit adds.

            S[g.bus][g.phase] -= complex(Pd[i, t], Qd[i, t])
        end
        Ibus = [conj.(S[b] ./ Vc[b]) for b in 1:nb]   # ---- bus current drawn, eq. (31) ---
        for bname in rev                              # ---- backward: currents, eq. (32) --
            b = bus_id[bname]
            b == islack && continue
            (_, k) = PARENT[bname]
            Ibr[k] = Ibus[b] + sum((Ibr[c] for c in CHILD_BR[b]), init = zeros(ComplexF64, 3))
        end
        for bname in ORDER                            # ---- forward: voltages, eq. (33) ---

            (par, k) = PARENT[bname]
            Vc[bus_id[bname]] = Vc[bus_id[par]] - BR[k].Z * Ibr[k]
        end
    end
    return Vc, Ibr
end
```

`BR[k].Z * Ibr[k]` is the whole of (33): a 3×3 complex matrix times a 3-vector. The mutual
terms are carried by the multiplication itself, and there is nowhere in that line for a
balance assumption to enter.

The audit is then four lines, run over the solved dispatch at every time step, with the
loops over buses, phases and inverters elided:

```julia
Vt        = sweep(t)                                              # |V⋆|, eqs. (30)–(35)
gap       = max(gap, maximum(abs.(V[:, :, t] .- Vt)))             # Δv,        eq. (36)
dev_true  = max(dev_true,  abs(Qdg_v[i, t] - dq(Vt[b, φ], qb)))   # ρ_true,    eq. (36)
dev_model = max(dev_model, abs(Qdg_v[i, t] - dq(V[b, φ, t], qb))) # ρ_model, Table 6
```
with `dq` the piecewise-linear curve of the inverter's own class, evaluated as an ordinary
`if-else`, which is perfectly legitimate here because every voltage handed to it is a
number rather than a decision variable.

**Table 7.** The exact-power-flow audit. Each solved dispatch is re-solved with a full three-phase backward/forward sweep, and compared against what the host predicted.

```@example tut
tp_audit_table()   # hide
```

```@example tut
tp_host_envelope_figure()   # hide
```

**Figure 7.** The two hosts' envelopes on one axis: same feeder, same dispatch problem, and a visible offset that is entirely the network model's doing.

The verdict is decisive, and it is the whole reason for carrying two hosts.

The IVACOPF dispatch reproduces the exact AC solution to about ``2\times10^{-11}`` p.u., so
the voltage each inverter was told to read *is* the voltage it would see, and the droop
residual survives the transfer intact: it stays at round-off. The LinDist3Flow dispatch
does not. Its voltages are off by ``1.3\times10^{-3}`` p.u., which sounds harmless until
you put it through the curve: the upper segment falls a full ``\bar q`` across 0.02 p.u.,
a slope of ``50\,\bar q`` per p.u. of voltage, so

```math
1.3\times10^{-3}\;\text{p.u. of voltage} \;\times\; 50\,\bar q
   \;=\; 0.065\,\bar q \;\approx\; 8\times10^{-3}\ \text{p.u. of VArs}
```

which is exactly the measured residual, and **about 6 % of that inverter's reactive
rating**. The inverters would not produce the VArs the model dispatched. A steep local
control law is an error amplifier, and it is the host that decides what gets amplified.

One feature of Table 7 is worth recording rather than glossing: *neither* host violates a
voltage limit, because the band is simply not binding on this feeder, so LinDist3Flow's
failure is confined to the droop residual and shows up nowhere in the constraint report.
The failure mode is not guaranteed to announce itself as an infeasibility or a limit
violation. On a feeder where the band did bind, the same voltage error would also have put
time steps outside ``[0.95, 1.05]``, but that is luck of the case rather than a property of
the model, which is precisely why the audit is worth running every time.

None of this is a defect of the droop block, and none of it is fixed by choosing a
different encoding. It is the price of dropping losses from the balance and of the
near-balanced-voltage assumption behind the ``a^R``, ``a^X`` coefficients, an assumption
that is *least* true on exactly the kind of unbalanced LV feeder where single-phase
inverters matter.

## What each host costs

**Table 8.** Successive-linearisation passes for the three-phase IVACOPF host, Lambda encoding, measured with the error metrics of (29).

```@example tut
tp_pass_table()   # hide
```

Three passes, and the error metrics fall by roughly three orders of magnitude each time,
the behaviour you would expect of a Taylor expansion refreshed about its own solution.
The objective moves by 5 % between the first and second pass and by ``5\times10^{-5}`` between
the second and third, so the first pass alone would have been meaningfully wrong and the
third is essentially free insurance. All three encodings take the same three passes, and
their first two passes agree to three significant figures on every metric; by the third
they are all far below tolerance and what separates them is solver noise. The outer loop
belongs to the host, not to the droop.

Note the second column of Table 8: **each pass is a complete MILP** (or NLP), so IVACOPF
costs one LinDist3Flow-sized solve per pass, on a model rather more than twice the size,
times the number of passes, plus a few seconds of warm-start sweeps. That is the whole of
the price, and Table 7 is what it buys.

**Table 9.** What changes between the two three-phase hosts.

| | LinDist3Flow | IVACOPF (3-phase) |
|:--|:--|:--|
| line equations | approximate: ``\alpha``-rotated drop coefficients, near-balance assumed | **exact**: ``\Delta V = ZI`` with full mutual coupling, nothing assumed |
| losses | dropped from the balance | modelled, via the current variables |
| line currents | not represented | decision variables, so the thermal limit (27) is writable |
| nonlinearity | none | two bus relations, ``v\cdot I`` and ``\lvert v\rvert``, linearised and iterated |
| solve | **one pass** | one MILP (or NLP) **per pass**, plus warm-start sweeps |
| dispatch on the real network | off the droop by a visible margin | on the droop to round-off |

The trade is the usual one, and it is the host's trade, not the encodings'. LinDist3Flow
is the right tool for a fast first look, for screening a fleet or a feeder before
committing to the expensive model, and for the scaling study below, where its single pass
is what isolates the cost of the droop block itself. **Use IVACOPF for anything
quantitative.**

## Does it scale?

The encodings are cheap to state; the question is whether they survive a network worth
calling realistic. The three LinDist3Flow scripts were run unchanged on a second real feeder
from the same ENWL family, `network_17_Feeder_6` [[15]](#ref-15), with **3856 buses, 3855 lines,
223 single-phase loads**, twenty times `network_5_Feeder_2` [[14]](#ref-14), by setting an
environment variable:

```bash
TP_CASE=network_17_Feeder_6 julia --project=examples/three_phase     examples/three_phase/LinDist3Flow_Lambda.jl
```

**Table 10.** Scalability of the three encodings on the LinDist3Flow host, across the 194-bus `network_5_Feeder_2` [[14]](#ref-14) and the 3856-bus `network_17_Feeder_6` [[15]](#ref-15). “Max droop deviation” is ``\Delta`` of (30), evaluated at each host's own voltages.

```@example tut
tp_scale_table()   # hide
```

Two things to take from this.

**The mixed-integer encodings scale.** Big-M and Lambda both carry a 3.3-million-variable
model over the full 96-step day and solve it in about a minute, roughly twelve times the
small feeder's solve for eighteen times the network, and the droop is still reproduced to
solver tolerance. The binary count does not move at all between the two feeders, because
it depends on inverters × time steps and not on network size. That is the useful property:
**enlarging the network grows the linear part of the problem, not the combinatorial part.**

**The integer-free encoding does not.** Heaviside is the cheapest of the three by variable
count (it adds nothing to the model) and it is comfortably the most expensive to solve.
On the small feeder it costs several times Lambda. On the large one at the full horizon
Ipopt gives up with `ERROR`; shortening the day to twelve steps brings it back to a
model an eighth the size, which then solves, in minutes rather than the seconds the
mixed-integer encodings need, but it solves, and the last row of Table 10 records what
comes back. The non-smoothness that costs nothing to write costs a great deal to
differentiate, and it is what limits this encoding long before the network does.

None of this changes which encoding is *correct*: all three reproduce the curve exactly,
here as before. It changes which one you would reach for on a feeder with an inverter at
every service connection.

The sweep is run on LinDist3Flow, because it is the host that isolates the *encodings’*
scaling: one solve each, no outer loop, so what Table 10 measures is the cost of the droop
block and nothing else. IVACOPF multiplies every row by its pass count, three passes on the
case study, on top of a larger model per pass, but the binary counts, which are the thing
at issue here, are identical in both hosts.

The sweep runs one process per row, separately from the case study above, so its timings
will not match that table to the second. Read both as orders of magnitude, as the warning
further up says.

## Running the three-phase examples

Every host × encoding pair has its own standalone script in
[`examples/three_phase/`](https://github.com/epsrlab-ub/SmartInverter-3P-DOPF.jl/tree/main/examples/three_phase).
All six share their skeleton verbatim (data, PV placement, verification, figures); a
`diff` between any two shows only the droop block, or only the network model:

**Table 11.** The six three-phase example scripts, one per host and encoding.

| | Big-M | Lambda / SOS2 | Heaviside |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **LinDist3Flow** | [`LinDist3Flow_BigM.jl`](https://github.com/epsrlab-ub/SmartInverter-3P-DOPF.jl/blob/main/examples/three_phase/LinDist3Flow_BigM.jl) | [`LinDist3Flow_Lambda.jl`](https://github.com/epsrlab-ub/SmartInverter-3P-DOPF.jl/blob/main/examples/three_phase/LinDist3Flow_Lambda.jl) | [`LinDist3Flow_Heaviside.jl`](https://github.com/epsrlab-ub/SmartInverter-3P-DOPF.jl/blob/main/examples/three_phase/LinDist3Flow_Heaviside.jl) |
| **IVACOPF** | [`IVACOPF3Ph_BigM.jl`](https://github.com/epsrlab-ub/SmartInverter-3P-DOPF.jl/blob/main/examples/three_phase/IVACOPF3Ph_BigM.jl) | [`IVACOPF3Ph_Lambda.jl`](https://github.com/epsrlab-ub/SmartInverter-3P-DOPF.jl/blob/main/examples/three_phase/IVACOPF3Ph_Lambda.jl) | [`IVACOPF3Ph_Heaviside.jl`](https://github.com/epsrlab-ub/SmartInverter-3P-DOPF.jl/blob/main/examples/three_phase/IVACOPF3Ph_Heaviside.jl) |

The Big-M and Lambda scripts need an MILP solver (Gurobi); the Heaviside ones need only
Ipopt.

```bash
julia --project=examples/three_phase examples/three_phase/IVACOPF3Ph_Lambda.jl
```

Each reads its feeder, horizon and fleet from the environment, so the same model runs on a
different network without touching the code:

**Table 12.** Environment overrides accepted by every three-phase script.

| variable | default | meaning |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `TP_CASE` | `network_5_Feeder_2` | ENWL feeder to load: `network_5_Feeder_2` [[14]](#ref-14) or `network_17_Feeder_6` [[15]](#ref-15) |
| `TP_STEPS` | `96` | time steps in the day |
| `TP_NPV` | `4` | smart inverters per phase |
| `TP_WARMSTART` | `sweep` | IVACOPF only: `flat` for the flat start of Soltani, Khorsand and Ma [[4]](#ref-4) |
| `TP_TOL` | `1e-6` | IVACOPF only: stop tolerance on ``\max(\text{MAPB}, \text{MRPB}, \text{MVM})``, eq. (29) |
| `TP_MAXITER` | `15` | IVACOPF only: pass limit |
| `TP_IMAXSEG` | `0` | IVACOPF only: sides of the polygon enforcing (27); 0 disables it |

```bash
TP_CASE=network_17_Feeder_6 TP_STEPS=24 julia --project=examples/three_phase examples/three_phase/IVACOPF3Ph_Lambda.jl
```


## Reproducing these results

The figures and tables on this page are drawn from results committed to the repository
under `docs/src/assets/results/threephase/`, so building the documentation needs no
solver. To regenerate them, which runs all six scripts across both hosts:

```bash
julia --project=examples/three_phase examples/three_phase/generate_results.jl
```

`TP_HOSTS=ivacopf` or `TP_HOSTS=lindist3flow` regenerates just one family. The scalability
table has its own sweep, which shells out to the scripts one per process:

```bash
julia --project=examples/three_phase examples/three_phase/scalability.jl
```

Between them those two commands run all three encodings on both hosts, with Gurobi and
Ipopt, and rewrite every JSON file this page reads. To run one encoding on one host
yourself, call its script directly:

```bash
julia --project=examples/three_phase examples/three_phase/IVACOPF3Ph_Lambda.jl
```

Each script prints its model size, the solve, the curtailed energy, the voltage range per
phase and the droop-deviation check of (30), and writes its own figures alongside.

## Takeaways

**Embedding is a correctness requirement, not a refinement.** Smart inverters follow
their curve, not a set-point; that is what IEEE Std 1547-2018 [[1]](#ref-1) obliges them
to do. Only a droop-aware DOPF returns a dispatch the fleet will actually deliver.

**Two exact families, one curve.** Integer encodings (Big-M, Lambda/SOS2) give an MILP;
non-smooth algebra (Heaviside) gives an NLP. All three reproduce the curve to
round-off and return the same dispatch. The choice is which solver world you want to
work in.

**The phase index is the whole of the three-phase difficulty, for the droop.** An
inverter senses one scalar, the voltage of its own bus on its own phase, and every
encoding above constrains one reactive output against that one scalar. What the phases
change is the network model underneath and the size of the fleet on top, not the algebra
of the curve. What they change decisively is the answer: on this feeder the three phases
sit at visibly different voltages and drive their inverters onto different segments of the
same curve at the same instant.

**The host is a separate decision, and it is the one that decides accuracy.** All three
encodings are exact *within* whatever model they sit in, linear or near-exact. What the
model resembles is the host's business: on the unbalanced LV feeder here, LinDist3Flow and
IVACOPF put the same inverters on the same curves and still disagree about the answer, and
only the exact power flow settles which to believe. Pick the encoding for the solver you
have; pick the host for the accuracy you need.

**Scale picks the method.** Binaries multiply with inverters × time steps, which is what
eventually breaks the MILP route on large fleets. The integer-free encoding avoids that
but hands the difficulty to the NLP solver, where the non-smoothness shows up as degraded
convergence and, on the largest feeder tried here, as a solve that does not finish at all.
